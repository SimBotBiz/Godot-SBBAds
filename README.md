## How to build

To use this module you need to build your own custom template for Android.

1. Get and setup the Godot Engine AndroidX Mod
[https://github.com/SimBotBiz/Godot-Engine-for-AndroidX](https://github.com/SimBotBiz/Godot-Engine-for-AndroidX)  

2. Before going any further, I strongly advise to do a test build to be sure everything is working fine.

3. Clone or download this repo

4. Copy *sbbads* and *sbbcmn* to the `modules\` folder of Godot Engine source

5. Check and edit configuration files:

    - `modules\sbbads\config.py`  
    You can enable or disable functionalities in the *artifacts* dictionary.

    - `modules\sbbads\play-services-ads\AndroidManifestChunk.xml`  
    You need to put there your AdMob App ID -> [(more infos)](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/quick-start#update_your_androidmanifestxml)

6. Rebuild the export templates

7. Use the export templates in your Godot App
    [https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/development/compiling/compiling_for_android.html#using-the-export-templates](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/development/compiling/compiling_for_android.html#using-the-export-templates)

8. Add the modules in the [android] section of your `project.godot` file

    ```py
    [android]
    modules="org/godotengine/godot/SBBPlayServicesAds,org/godotengine/godot/SBBConsent"
    ```

## How to use

A working Godot example is provided in the *example* folder of this repo, I will write a more detailed documentations soon.

In the meantime if you want to play with the example remember that you need to:

1. Update the paths for the export templates and the debug keystore.

    You can do that easily editing the `export_presets.cfg` file:

    ```py
    [preset.0.options]
    custom_package/debug="C:/my/path/to/android_debug.apk"
    custom_package/release="C:/my/path/to/android_release.apk"
    keystore/debug="C:/my/path/to/debug.keystore"
    ```

2. Use your Publisher Id in `ConsentTest.gd`

    ```py
    var publisher_ids: Array = ["pub-0123456789012345"]
    ```
